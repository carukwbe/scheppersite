"valid amount" here means the price of the first or second preisstufe or the helper price. These prices are considered in
the transaction processor. Each transaction where the transferred amount is one of these prices and the order id is
correct is marked as correct, and only in a second step it is checked whether the price is actually the one in the
ticket. The "valid amount and false amount" can happen if someone transfers the helper price despite not having booked
a helper ticket.

"correct amount" means the price that is present in the ticket order.
